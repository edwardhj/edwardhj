### My Professional Self üè¢
I am a detail-oriented and motivated Full Stack Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, California. 

I have a BS in Business Administration and a BS in Accounting from the University of Southern California. Post graduation, I'm a consultant for KPMG, based out of the Los Angeles office.
Currently, I'm pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania

When I'm not busy at work, I spend my time taking classes, learning more about software engineering! I love all aspects of technology and am deeply interested in programming solutions that will spark societal change.

### My Personal Self üè°
Apart from learning, I love snowboarding, golfing, playing basketball and soccer. You can catch me at the local 24-Hour Fitness, spending hours at a time improving various aspects of my basketball game from shooting to dribbling to passing.

I am also deeply involved in missions, providing humanitarian relief & support to underdeveloped villages in 3rd world countries from Mexico to Thailand.
